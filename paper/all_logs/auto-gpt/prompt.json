The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

These documents include Tesla income statement, its balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. Tesla investors use historical funamental indicators, such as Tesla's Return on Investment, to determine how well the company is positioned to perform in the future. Although Tesla investors may use each financial statement separately, they are all related. The changes in Tesla's assets and liabilities, for example, are also reflected in the revenues and expenses that we see on Tesla's income statement, which results in the company's gains or losses. Cash flows can provide more information regarding cash listed on a balance sheet, but not equivalent to net income shown on the income statement. We offer a historical overview of the basic patterns found on Tesla Financial Statements. Understanding these patterns can help to make the right decision on long term investment in Tesla.

The overall investor sentiment generally increases the direction of a stock movement in a one-year investment horizon. However, the impact of investor sentiment on the entire stock market does not have solid backing from leading economists and market statisticians. Investor biases related to Tesla's public news can be used to forecast risks associated with an investment in Tesla. The trend in average sentiment can be used to explain how an investor holding Tesla can time the market purely based on public headlines and social activities around Tesla Inc.

Investors also form their own opinion of Tesla's value that differs from its market value or its book value, called intrinsic value, which is Tesla's true underlying value. Investors use various methods to calculate intrinsic value and buy a stock when its market value falls below its intrinsic value. Because Tesla's market value can be influenced by many factors that don't directly affect Tesla's underlying business (such as a pandemic or basic market pessimism), market value can vary widely from intrinsic value.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

So even if the number exists twice, you won't be able to use it. You should instead build a dictionary of number => indices and iterate over that. \u2013\u00a0fafl Jun 7, 2018 at 14:22 @mkrieger1 it supposes to return the indices of the two value in nums that will add up to the target in the form [i,j] \u2013\u00a0Eliza Jun 7, 2018 at 14:28 @fafl I see. So it only finds the first occurance of that value.. sad.

I found 3 main ways to solve this question, the 1st approach is brute force with time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): for i in range(0, len(array)): for j in range(i+1, len(array)): if array[i] + array[j] == targetSum: return ([array[i], array[j]]) return [] The 2nd approach is using hash map with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): matches = {} for number in array: match = targetSum - number if match in matches: return [match, number] else: matches[number] = True return [] The 3rd approach is with two pointers of left and right. This method has time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): array.sort() left = 0 right = len(array) - 1 while left < right: if array[left] + array[right] == targetSum: return [array[left], array[right]] elif array[left] + array[right] < targetSum: left +=1 elif array[left] + array[right] > targetSum: right -=1 return [] ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 5, 2021 at 14:35 Niyousha MohammadshafieNiyousha Mohammadshafie 19111 silver badge66 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

This works and can do it in a single pass: from collections import defaultdict # Returns the indices of two numbers that add up to the target def two_sums(nums, target): lookup = defaultdict(list) for i, num in enumerate(nums): needed = target - num if needed in lookup: return [lookup[needed][0], i] lookup[num].append(i) return None print(two_sums([2,7,11,15], 17)) print(two_sums([3, 3], 6)) ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Jun 7, 2018 at 14:31 faflfafl 7,21233 gold badges2727 silver badges5050 bronze badges 2 1 This is a great solution using defaultdict to avoid key error.

We have to return the indices of two integers, such that if we add them up, we will reach to a specific target that is also given. Here we will take one assumption, that is always there will be one unique solution in the array, so no two set of indices for same target will be there.For an example, suppose the array is like A = [2, 8, 12, 15], and the target sum is 20. Then it will return indices 1 and 2, as A[1] + A[2] = 20.To solve this, we will loop through each element of the array. So follow these steps to solve this.Define one map to hold the result called resFor index i in range 0 to n \u2013 1 (where n is the number of elements in the array)if target \u2212 A[i] is present in resreturn res[target \u2212 A[i]] and i as indicesOtherwise put i into the res as res[A[i]] \u2212 = iLet us see the implementation to get better understandingExample\u00a0Live Democlass Solution(object): def twoSum(self, nums, target): \"\"\" :type nums: List[int] :type target: int :rtype: List[int] \"\"\" required = {} for i in range(len(nums)): if target - nums[i] in required: return [required[target - nums[i]],i] else: required[nums[i]]=i input_list = [2,8,12,15] ob1 = Solution() print(ob1.twoSum(input_list, 20))Inputinput_list = [2,8,12,15] target = 20Output[1, 2] Arnab Chakraborty Updated on 28-Apr-2020 08:04:05 11K+ Views Print Article Related ArticlesSum of Two Integers in Python Two Sum Less Than K in Python Check if sum of divisors of two numbers are same in Python Program to find maximum sum of two non-overlapping sublists in Python Two Sum BSTs in C++ Program to find the sum of the lengths of two nonoverlapping sublists whose sum is given in Python Two sum in BSTs in JavaScript Path Sum in Python Combination Sum in Python sum() function in Python Program to find minimum operations needed to make two arrays sum equal in Python Minimum Path Sum in Python Find sub-arrays from given two arrays such that they have equal sum in Python Program to find sum of two numbers which are less than the target in Python Reverse sum of two arrays in JavaScript Previous Page Next Page Advertisements Annual Membership Enjoy unlimited access on 5500+ Hand Picked Quality Video Courses Subscribe Now Training for a Team Affordable solution to train a team and make them project ready.

Show activity on this post. Here's my solution for the LeetCode's Two Sum problem. Problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1] My solution: def twoSum(nums, target): \"\"\" :type nums: List[int] :type target: int :rtype: List[int] \"\"\" num_lst = list(range(len(nums))) for indx, num in enumerate(num_lst): for num_other in num_lst[indx+1:]: if nums[num] + nums[num_other] == target: return [num, num_other] else: continue return None I would love feedback on code efficiency and style/formatting. pythonpython-3.xk-sum ShareShare a link to this question Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications edited Jun 9, 2022 at 18:00 Mast\u2666 13.1k1111 gold badges5151 silver badges108108 bronze badges asked Jan 25, 2019 at 17:32 zthomas.nczthomas.nc 57522 gold badges77 silver badges1616 bronze badges 2 2 Would any of the lists contain negative numbers? \u2013\u00a0MSeifert Jan 26, 2019 at 14:00 @MSeifert I don't know, but feel free to assume yes \u2013\u00a0zthomas.nc Jan 27, 2019 at 18:06 Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) This answer is useful 19 This answer is not useful Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Code Style Your code contains a few lines that accomplish nothing and obfuscate your intent: else: continue If the conditional is false, you'll automatically continue on to the next iteration without having to tell the program to do that. return None All Python functions implicitly return None. While PEP 8 appears to endorse this practice (\"explicit is better than implicit\"), it seems noisy to me. num_lst = list(range(len(nums))) effectively generates a list of all the indices in the nums input list. Then, you immediately enumerate this list, which produces pairs of identical indices indx, num. If all you're attempting to do is iterate, this is significant obfuscation; simply call enumerate directly on nums to produce index-element tuples: def twoSum(self, nums, target): for i, num in enumerate(nums): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if num + nums[j] == target: return [i, j] This makes the intent much clearer: there are no duplicate variables with different names representing the same thing. It also saves unnecessary space and overhead associated with creating a list from a range. Following on the previous item, indx, num and num_lst are confusing variable names, especially when they're all actually indices (which are technically numbers). Efficiency This code is inefficient, running in quadratic time, or O(n2)O(n2). Leetcode is generous to let this pass (but won't be so forgiving in the future!). The reason for this is the nested loop; for every element in your list, you iterate over every other element to draw comparisons. A linear solution should finish in ~65 ms, while this takes ~4400 ms. Here is an efficient solution that runs in O(n)O(n) time: hist = {} for i, n in enumerate(nums): if target - n in hist: return [hist[target-n], i] hist[n] = i How does this work? The magic of hashing. The dictionary hist offers constant O(1)O(1) lookup time. Whenever we visit a new element in nums, we check to see if its sum complement is in the dictionary; else, we store it in the dictionary as a num => index pair. This is the classic time-space tradeoff: the quadratic solution is slow but space efficient, while this solution takes more space but gains a huge boost in speed. In almost every case, choose speed over space. For completeness, even if you were in a space-constrained environment, there is a fast solution that uses O(1)O(1) space and O(nlogn)O(nlogn) time. This solution is worth knowing about for the practicality of the technique and the fact that it's a common interview follow-up. The way it works is: Sort nums. Create two pointers representing an index at 0 and an index at len(nums) - 1. Sum the elements at the pointers. If they produce the desired sum, return the pointer indices. Otherwise, if the sum is less than the target, increment the left pointer Otherwise, decrement the right pointer. Go back to step 3 unless the pointers are pointing to the same element, in which case return failure. Be wary of list slicing; it's often a hidden linear performance hit. Removing this slice as the nested loop code above illustrates doesn't improve the quadratic time complexity, but it does reduce overhead. Now you're ready to try 3 Sum!

I can amend my recommendation to be \"at least be aware that Python statements implicitly return None\". Maybe Python should also put else: continue at the end of every loop, just to be explicit :-) \u2013\u00a0ggorlen Jan 26, 2019 at 1:58 Python should, but doesn't know not to copy the entire thing. It has no such optimisation. \u2013\u00a0wizzwizz4 Jan 26, 2019 at 16:44 @wizzwizz4 No lazy copying? E.g. return a pointer in O(1) to the slice element and then wait for mutation to perform a copy?

Show activity on this post. num_lst = list(range(len(nums))) for indx, num in enumerate(num_lst): I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but I think not. I ran this code nums = [2,5,7,9] num_lst = list(range(len(nums))) list(enumerate(num_lst)) output : [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)] So why do you create the list and then enumerate it? Maybe what you want to do is simply : enumerate(nums) then enumerate(nums[index+1:]) on your other loop? A simpler way would be to only use the ranges, as I'll show below. Also, given your input, there's a possibility that a single number would be higher than the target, in this case you shouldn't make the second iteration. You also don't need the else: continue , as it's going to continue either way. I'd end up with : def twoSum(nums, target): \"\"\" :type nums: List[int] :type target: int :rtype: List[int] \"\"\" for i1 in range(len(nums)): if nums[i1] > target: continue for i2 in range(i1 + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i1] + nums[i2] == target: return [i1, i2] return None Without knowing the expected input size, it's hard to focus on performance improvements.

It doesn't work with negative numbers, it doesn't even work with 0 reliably (twoSum([2,0], 2)) and it uses the same number twice (twoSum([1, 1], 2)). :-/ \u2013\u00a0Eric Duminil Jan 26, 2019 at 15:16 @EricDuminil The latter is fine; number ! = element. \u2013\u00a0wizzwizz4 Jan 26, 2019 at 16:46 1 @wizzwizz4: Thanks for the comment.

And without the expected size of input it's hard to tell if there's a real performance value to my answer (and to any other one at that, if we always expect 4 numbers, performance isn't really an issue).

Show activity on this post. You can use itertools.combinations for a more readable (and likely faster) for loop. As long as returning a list isn't a requirement, I would consider it better style to return a tuple instead. (Especially since it allows you to convey the list length.) Also, as long as the current name isn't a requirement, it is preferable to use snake_case for function and variable names. from itertools import combinations def twoSum(nums, target): \"\"\" :type nums: List[int] :type target: int :rtype: List[int] \"\"\" for (i, first), (j, second) in combinations(enumerate(nums), 2): if first + second == target: return [i, j] return None ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Jan 26, 2019 at 15:03 answered Jan 26, 2019 at 1:59 Solomon UckoSolomon Ucko 1,56611 gold badge1010 silver badges1717 bronze badges 1 1 You don't need to create num_list anymore.

So even if the number exists twice, you won't be able to use it. You should instead build a dictionary of number => indices and iterate over that. \u2013\u00a0fafl Jun 7, 2018 at 14:22 @mkrieger1 it supposes to return the indices of the two value in nums that will add up to the target in the form [i,j] \u2013\u00a0Eliza Jun 7, 2018 at 14:28 @fafl I see. So it only finds the first occurance of that value.. sad.

Show activity on this post. I found 3 main ways to solve this question, the 1st approach is brute force with time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): for i in range(0, len(array)): for j in range(i+1, len(array)): if array[i] + array[j] == targetSum: return ([array[i], array[j]]) return [] The 2nd approach is using hash map with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): matches = {} for number in array: match = targetSum - number if match in matches: return [match, number] else: matches[number] = True return [] The 3rd approach is with two pointers of left and right. This method has time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): array.sort() left = 0 right = len(array) - 1 while left < right: if array[left] + array[right] == targetSum: return [array[left], array[right]] elif array[left] + array[right] < targetSum: left +=1 elif array[left] + array[right] > targetSum: right -=1 return [] ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 5, 2021 at 14:35 Niyousha MohammadshafieNiyousha Mohammadshafie 19111 silver badge66 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

This works and can do it in a single pass: from collections import defaultdict # Returns the indices of two numbers that add up to the target def two_sums(nums, target): lookup = defaultdict(list) for i, num in enumerate(nums): needed = target - num if needed in lookup: return [lookup[needed][0], i] lookup[num].append(i) return None print(two_sums([2,7,11,15], 17)) print(two_sums([3, 3], 6)) ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Jun 7, 2018 at 14:31 faflfafl 7,21233 gold badges2727 silver badges5050 bronze badges 2 1 This is a great solution using defaultdict to avoid key error. Thanks a lot! \u2013\u00a0Eliza Jun 7, 2018 at 14:43 You don't even need to save a list of indices, the last one would be totally enough \u2013\u00a0fafl Jun 8, 2018 at 16:21 Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

Another solution might be: def two_sum(nums, target): d = {} for i in range(len(nums)): x = nums[i] if target - x in dict: return (d[target - x] + 1, i + 1) d[x] = i return None ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Oct 19, 2018 at 20:58 zx485 28.5k2828 gold badges5050 silver badges5959 bronze badges answered Oct 19, 2018 at 19:16 Mehmet Fatih YasarMehmet Fatih Yasar 3933 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 0 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The United States is Tesla's largest sales market. Revenue rises on model additions More than 71 billion U.S. dollars of the company's revenue is generated from Tesla's automotive segment, which includes the design, manufacturing, and sales of vehicles. As of March 2020, the electric vehicle (EV) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Tesla Model 3, and the Tesla Model Y. The production of the anticipated Cybertruck, the brand's light truck model, has been delayed. Mass production for the model is estimated to happen in 2024. Model 3 legacy The Model Y has emerged as Tesla's best-selling vehicle, leading the ranking in worldwide plug-in vehicle sales in 2022. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass one million global sales. Much of Tesla's spending has specifically been on production of its Model 3 and Model Y, a strongly popular vehicles with high demand. One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market, a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies.

The company's flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Tesla, which has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years, is now a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021.? The EV king's market capitalization is more than the combined value of legacy automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors and Ford.Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making more affordable EVs for the masses. The firm's three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing, and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, which is touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer.

The company's flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Tesla, which has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years, is now a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021.? The EV king's market capitalization is more than the combined value of legacy automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors and Ford.Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making more affordable EVs for the masses. The firm's three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing, and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, which is touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer.
