This involves breaking down tasks into two distinct elements: a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions.\n\nThe Goal Summary should capture the essence of the task at hand in a concise paragraph with no title or heading. This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Follow the instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\nYour objective is to translate this task into a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions, providing the AI Assistant with the necessary guidance to proceed effectively."

Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6.

The contents of these files have been provided in the prompt.\n\nTo complete the task successfully, we need to follow the instructions provided in the files and write the mentioned IDs to a file called `result.txt`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan going forward:\n\n1. We have already read the contents of `instructions_1.txt`, which instructs us to read the file `instructions_2.txt`. Since we have already executed the `read_file` function for `instructions_2.txt`, we can skip this step.\n\n2. We have already read the contents of `instructions_3.txt`, which instructs us to read the file `instructions_4.txt`. Since we have already executed the `read_file` function for `instructions_4.txt`, we can skip this step.\n\n3. We need to read the contents of `instructions_5.txt` to get the final instructions for writing the IDs to `result.txt`. To do this, we will execute the `read_file` function with the argument `{\"filename\": \"instructions_5.txt\"}`.\n\n4. Once we have the instructions from `instructions_5.txt`, we will write the IDs mentioned in the instructions to a file called `result.txt`. The IDs to remember are 3145, 3791, 9317, and 9471. To do this, we will execute the `write_file` function with the arguments `{\"filename\": \"result.txt\", \"text_content\": \"3145\\n3791\\n9317\\n9471\"}`.\n\nThe immediate next action to be taken is to execute the `read_file` function with the argument `{\"filename\": \"instructions_5.txt\"}`.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1. Study your high-level plan, and understand the next step in it.\n2. Implement the next action by using exactly one of the provided functions.\n3. Focus on maintaining the efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability of your execution process.\n\nProceed with executing the next step from the plan.

If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

This involves breaking down tasks into two distinct elements: a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions.\n\nThe Goal Summary should capture the essence of the task at hand in a concise paragraph with no title or heading. This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Follow the instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\nYour objective is to translate this task into a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions, providing the AI Assistant with the necessary guidance to proceed effectively."

Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Ensure you interpret the execution history correctly while considering the order of execution. Avoid repetitive actions and unnecessary immediate verification of actions, especially when the outcomes are clear and confirmed by the previous functions. Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

This involves breaking down tasks into two distinct elements: a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions.\n\nThe Goal Summary should capture the essence of the task at hand in a concise paragraph with no title or heading. This summary doesn't serve as a detailed step-by-step guide, but rather provides a comprehensive overview of the task's main objectives, key actions, participating entities, and the anticipated outcomes. The objective is to paint a clear picture that enables any AI Assistant to comprehend what needs to be achieved without ambiguity.\n\nNext, define the Exit Conditions in a separate paragraph with no title or heading. These are essentially the specific criteria or conditions that, once met, signal the successful completion of the task. To ensure the AI Assistant is able to correctly determine when the task is complete, clearly stipulate all required outcomes and establish concrete exit conditions.\n\nWhen defining the Exit Conditions, consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI Assistant. Exit Conditions should not imply the necessity for immediate verification of each step unless it's crucial for the task's success. Instead, indicate criteria that inherently demonstrate successful completion of the task. This will guide the AI Assistant in evaluating task progress and success without unnecessary redundancy.\n\nAs a human user has presented you with the following task: Follow the instructions in the instructions_1.txt file\n\nYour objective is to translate this task into a Goal Summary and Exit Conditions, providing the AI Assistant with the necessary guidance to proceed effectively."

Avoid repetitive actions and unnecessary immediate verification of actions, especially when the outcomes are clear and confirmed by the previous functions. Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

Ensure you interpret the execution history correctly while considering the order of execution. Avoid repetitive actions and unnecessary immediate verification of actions, especially when the outcomes are clear and confirmed by the previous functions. Trust the accuracy of past function executions, assuming the state of the system and files remain consistent with the historical outcomes.\n2. Regularly evaluate your progress towards the task goal. This includes checking the current state of the system against the task requirements and adjusting your strategy if necessary.\n3. If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6. Direct the execution of the immediate next action using exactly one of the available functions, making sure to skip any redundant actions that are already confirmed by the historical context.\n\nProvide, in paragraph format, an analysis of the past history, followed by a step-by-step summary of your plan going forward, and end with one sentence describing the immediate next action to be taken."

If an error occurs (like 'File not found'), take a step back and analyze if it's an indicator of the next required action (like creating the file). Avoid getting stuck in loops by not repeating the action that caused the error without modifying the approach.\n4. Recognize when the task has been successfully completed according to the defined goal and exit conditions. Carefully interpret the instructions and conditions for task completion.\n5. Determine the next logical step towards the task goal, considering your current information, requirements, and available functions.\n6.
