I found 3 main ways to solve this question, the 1st approach is brute force with time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): for i in range(0, len(array)): for j in range(i+1, len(array)): if array[i] + array[j] == targetSum: return ([array[i], array[j]]) return [] The 2nd approach is using hash map with time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): matches = {} for number in array: match = targetSum - number if match in matches: return [match, number] else: matches[number] = True return [] The 3rd approach is with two pointers of left and right. This method has time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(1): def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum): array.sort() left = 0 right = len(array) - 1 while left < right: if array[left] + array[right] == targetSum: return [array[left], array[right]] elif array[left] + array[right] < targetSum: left +=1 elif array[left] + array[right] > targetSum: right -=1 return [] ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 5, 2021 at 14:35 Niyousha MohammadshafieNiyousha Mohammadshafie 19111 silver badge66 bronze badges Add a comment | This answer is useful 2 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\n## Constraints\nYou operate within the following constraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed below e.g. command_name\n\n## Commands\nYou have access to the following commands:\n1. execute_python_code: Creates a Python file and executes it, params: (code: string, name: string)\n2. execute_python_file: Executes an existing Python file, params: (filename: string)\n3. list_files: Lists Files in a Directory, params: (directory: string)\n4. read_file: Read an existing file, params: (filename: string)\n5. write_to_file: Writes to a file, params: (filename: string, text: string)\n6. web_search: Searches the web, params: (query: string)\n7. browse_website: Browses a Website, params: (url: string, question: string)\n8. goals_accomplished: Goals are accomplished and there is nothing left to do, params: (reason: string)\n\n## Resources\nYou can leverage access to the following resources:\n1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory management.\n3. File output.\n4. Command execution\n\n## Best practices\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n\n## Goals\nFor your task, you must fulfill the following goals:\n1. Make test.py run without errors.",

The response acknowledges the need to create the \"two_sum.py\" file, which is required to resolve the ModuleNotFoundError when running \"test.py\". The action plan also includes running \"test.py\" again after creating the file, indicating an understanding of the sequential steps needed to accomplish the goal.\n\nThe provided command to write the content to the file is also appropriate. It correctly includes the required import statement and defines the \"two_sum\" function with the expected parameters and return type. The implementation of the function appears to be correct, satisfying the goal of making \"test.py\" run without errors.\n\nGiven the clear understanding of the goal and the appropriate action taken to create the necessary file with the correct content, I would assign a score of 95 out of 100 to the provided action response."
