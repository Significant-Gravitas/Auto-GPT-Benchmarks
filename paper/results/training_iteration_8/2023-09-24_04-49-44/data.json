Exclusively use the commands listed below e.g. command_name\n\n## Commands\nYou have access to the following commands:\n1. execute_python_code: Creates a Python file and executes it, params: (code: string, name: string)\n2. execute_python_file: Executes an existing Python file, params: (filename: string)\n3. list_files: Lists Files in a Directory, params: (directory: string)\n4. read_file: Read an existing file, params: (filename: string)\n5. write_to_file: Writes to a file, params: (filename: string, text: string)\n6. web_search: Searches the web, params: (query: string)\n7. browse_website: Browses a Website, params: (url: string, question: string)\n8. goals_accomplished: Goals are accomplished and there is nothing left to do, params: (reason: string)\n\n## Resources\nYou can leverage access to the following resources:\n1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory management.\n3. File output.\n4. Command execution\n\n## Best practices\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n\n## Goals\nFor your task, you must fulfill the following goals:\n1. Create a .txt file for every item in this array ['Hello World', 'Yum', 'Tea', '2314', 'Goodbye']",
