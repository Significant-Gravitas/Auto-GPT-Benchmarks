When someone clicks on the word 'Dog', a message should appear that says 'Dogs are known as man's best friend!'. You'll need to make a list with the name 'Dog' and then write a little bit of JavaScript to make the message appear when the name is clicked. Mark the div containing dog with the id 'dog'. Put the message inside a <div> with the id 'info'. Create a single html file called animal_list.html.",
