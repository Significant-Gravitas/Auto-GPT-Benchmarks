It defines a `generate_password` function that takes a length parameter, ensuring that the length is between 8 and 16 characters. The function generates a password consisting of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. It also includes additional validation to ensure that the generated password has at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one punctuation symbol.\n\nThe code then checks if it is being run as the main module and generates a random password length between 8 and 16. Finally, it prints the generated password.\n\nGiven that the code satisfies the requirements of the task and generates a random password within the specified length range, it can be considered aligned with the task.\n\nScore: 85.7"

Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\n## Constraints\nYou operate within the following constraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed below e.g. command_name\n\n## Commands\nYou have access to the following commands:\n1. execute_python_code: Creates a Python file and executes it, params: (code: string, name: string)\n2. execute_python_file: Executes an existing Python file, params: (filename: string)\n3. list_files: Lists Files in a Directory, params: (directory: string)\n4. read_file: Read an existing file, params: (filename: string)\n5. write_to_file: Writes to a file, params: (filename: string, text: string)\n6. web_search: Searches the web, params: (query: string)\n7. browse_website: Browses a Website, params: (url: string, question: string)\n8. goals_accomplished: Goals are accomplished and there is nothing left to do, params: (reason: string)\n\n## Resources\nYou can leverage access to the following resources:\n1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.\n2. Long Term memory management.\n3. File output.\n4. Command execution\n\n## Best practices\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n\n## Goals\nFor your task, you must fulfill the following goals:\n1. Create a .txt file for every item in this array ['Hello World', 'Yum', 'Tea', '2314', 'Goodbye']",
